Request help on the following.

	1.	How to fill the width of the page and make it dynamic relative to device used.

	2.	I had to change the icon color through inline CSS as I was not able to do this through CSS. I need help with this.

	3.	I could not change the line width of the icons on the sidebar.

	4.	I was not able to understand the rendering of the text "If it Ain't Love Catson Derulo". I needed to put a negative margen to get it inline with the picture.

	5.	How to get the footer over the sidebar?

	6.	How to put the footer at the end of the page and how can I define the length of the page?

	7. 	I need to understand the positioning of elements a little more.
